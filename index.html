            <ul>
                <li>Chameleons change their colour due to a number of different factors, including their mood, changes in light or temperature, or the humidity of their environment.</li>
                <li>They can move their eyes separately, with each eye having a field of 180 degrees. This means they can see 360 degrees if they need to!</li>
                <li>59 unique species of chameleon live on the island of Madagascar and are found nowhere else. This is over a quarter of the worldâ€™s 202 species.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Giant pandas spend 10-16 hours a day feeding, mainly on bamboo.</li>
                <li>Although pandas are 99% vegetarian their digestive system is typical of a carnivore. For the 1% of their diet that isn't bamboo, pandas eat eggs, small animals, carrion, and forage in farmland for pumpkin, kidney beans, wheat and domestic pig food. </li>
                <li>Sometimes, to mark their scent, panda's climb a tree backwards with their hindfeet until they're in a full handstand upside down - enabling them to leave their scent higher up. </li>
            </ul>
